I wrote these scripts to webscrape HackerNews, StackOverflow, and CS subreddits to collect data in support of a private group project.

# TODO:

Read not only titles and OP, but also ALL comments in a subreddit over time. 

Automate the screening of filler words such as "the" and "a".

AI/ML to summarize overarching trends on Reddit + report HOT-TREND headlines to humans. 

Then add the ability to provide spontaneous, pertinent, personalized messages to the user. And expand to increasing sources of information.

## UseCase Example: 
I bought a new macbook, they are not #1 for gaming, but they are absolutely excellent for productivity.
I also simply found it to have the most upbeat environment of the top 3 operating systems.
Anyway, upon receiving it from Amazon, I immediately upgraded to the newest macOS **Ventura** 13.X from macOS **Monterey** 12.X.
Then I read up on the mac subreddit on how to optimally utilize my new 2022 M2 Macbook Air.
**The comments on reddit are mostly that Ventura currently has some bugs that didn't exist in Monterey.**
I wish that I'd known that before "upgrading" the OS lol.
*Cue helpful AI buddy who has the ability to provide spontaneous, pertinent, personalized messages.*


(That being said, I'm not futzing about the Ventura 13.X too much, and am still extremely pleased with Apple regarding this product.)

An AI text scanner that could continuously scan the comments of reddit... and concisely report trends that may interest the user (AKA personalized) would be very convenient. Additionally, this concept could be expanded to not only search reddit, but also numerous other sources. e.g. Youtube, News, Entertainment, recent scholarly articles, etc. And not only to store the knowledge found for later access by a user, but also provide spontaneous messages to its user regarding recent trends that the owner may be interested in. e.g. Similar to personalized ads, but very different with a more helpful scope.

Of course youtube has a non-AI/ML un-personalized notification system set-up to let you know about youtube videos you might enjoy. And news headlines have their own notifications and attention-grabbing mechanisms. The same applies to movies, shows, songs, albums, books, articles, food at your favorite restaurants, all organizations'/companies' specific products, etc. But for a single AI to be a single consolidated source of easily digestable information for ALL of these things, collecting knowledge through expansive cloud infrastructure that searches for all new information, and notifies you of the MOST important, relevant, and personalized updates... With more sources of information being added over time. 

Many might not want the integration of ads for taking up attention. Or at least a paid option to turn off the ads, or better yet relegate them to some designated adspace that is easy for users to circumvent if intentional, yet also appealing enough that some users leisurely browse the adspace and businesses are willing to pay for the opportunity to advertise.

Then just throw in some sensors, a robot body, and combine it with every other existing AI. e.g. Add a chess-playing library for the AI to access, add a medical diagnostic module, add the most-up-to date accounting, law, financial, etc... And modules for mobile capabilities with the robot's physical body, and vision of the electromagnetic spectrum using photoresistors/photocells/spectrometers along with sensors/receptors for the other 5 senses. Add "mode"/"profile" functionality e.g. Eventually the AI robots can be mass-produced and each individually customizable with a profile/mode for "grocery stocker", "garbage collector", "construction worker", "underground miner", "math teacher", etc. Or even a "CEO" profile! Like that NetDragon company that made an AI its CEO lol!
