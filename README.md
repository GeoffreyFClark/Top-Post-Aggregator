# TODO:

Read not only titles and OP, but also ALL comments in a subreddit over time. 
AI/ML to understand overarching trends on Reddit + report HOT-TREND headlines to humans. 

## UseCase Example: 
I bought a new macbook, they are #1 for gaming, but they are absolutely excellent for productivity and creativity.
I also simply found it to have the most upbeat environment of the top 3 operating systems.
Anyway, upon receiving it from Amazon, I immediately installed the newest macOS **Ventura** 13.X from macOS **Monterey** 12.X.
Then I read up on the mac subreddit on how to optimally utilize my new 2022 M2 Macbook Air.
**The comments on reddit are mostly that Ventura is a shitshow.**
I wish that I'd known that before "upgrading" lol
Overall, I'm not futzing about it too much, and I'm extremely pleased with Apple on this. 
I've used Windows my whole life, and was just mind-blown by all the small conveniences that added up with the Mac.

In conclusion, an AI text scanner that could continuously scan the comments of reddit and report hot trend headlines would be very convenient for writing news headlines, capture current trends, and to consumers like myself who just want to be aware of currently-relevant-information that I would like to know about.
