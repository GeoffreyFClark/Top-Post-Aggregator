# TODO:

Read not only titles and OP, but also ALL comments in a subreddit over time. 

Automate the screening of filler words such as "the" and "a".

AI/ML to summarize overarching trends on Reddit + report HOT-TREND headlines to humans. 

## UseCase Example: 
I bought a new macbook, they are not #1 for gaming, but they are absolutely excellent for productivity and creativity.
I also simply found it to have the most upbeat environment of the top 3 operating systems.
Anyway, upon receiving it from Amazon, I immediately installed the newest macOS **Ventura** 13.X from macOS **Monterey** 12.X.
Then I read up on the mac subreddit on how to optimally utilize my new 2022 M2 Macbook Air.
**The comments on reddit are mostly that Ventura is a shitshow.**
I wish that I'd known that before "upgrading" lol
Overall, I'm not futzing about it too much, and I'm extremely pleased with Apple on this. 
I've used Windows my whole life, and was just mind-blown by all the small conveniences that added up with the Mac.

In conclusion, an AI text scanner that could continuously scan the comments of reddit... and concisely report trend that may interest the used (AKA personalized) would be very convenient. Additionally, this concept could be expanded to not only search reddit, but also numerous other sources. e.g. Youtube, News, Entertainment, recent scholarly articles, etc. And not only to internalize the knowledge found, but provides spotaneous messages to its owner regarding recent trends that the owner may be interested in. e.g. I would like an AI helper buddy that could be like if Google could let me know if something new that interests me comes out like a new movie that my AI buddy knows I personally would enjoy. e.g. If I just received a particularly important or urgent email that I should be notified of.

Of course youtube has a non-AI/ML un-personalized notification system set-up to let you know about youtube videos you might enjoy. And news headlines have their own notifications and attention-grabbing macheanisms. And videogame websites have their own notifications, and new scholarly articles get attention from blog posts, articles, word of mouth, forums, etc. 

But for a single AI to be the primary source of information for ALL of these things, collecting knowledge through expansive cloud infrastructure that consolidates all new information, and notifies you of the MOST important, relevant, and personalized updates. And more sources of information could be added over time. I'd really not want the integration of ads for taking up attention. Or at least a paid option to turn off the ads, or better yet relegate them to some designated adspace that is easy for intentional users to circumvent, yet also appealing enough for businesses to want to pay money to advertise with.

Then just throw some sensors, a robot body, and combine it with every other existing AI. e.g. add chess-playing library for the AI to access, add a medical diagnostic library, add an most up to date of all current information accounting library, saw thing with a law library, add a financial library... And modules to add mobility to the robot's physical body, and sense the electromagnetic spectrum out of your photoresistors/photocells/spectrometers along with sensors/receptors for the other 5 senses. Then options such as sports-playing for the AI to use its physical robot body, a travel module (e.g. Not just knowing how to walk, pick things up, or operate machines... but also knowing how to make travel as efficient as possible, even over long commutes). Add "profile" functionality e.g. the AI robot can work as a grocery stocker or load up a "miner" or "construction worker" profile.
