# TODO:

Read not only titles and OP, but also ALL comments in a subreddit over time. 

Automate the screening of filler words such as "the" and "a".

AI/ML to summarize overarching trends on Reddit + report HOT-TREND headlines to humans. 

## UseCase Example: 
I bought a new macbook, they are not #1 for gaming, but they are absolutely excellent for productivity and creativity.
I also simply found it to have the most upbeat environment of the top 3 operating systems.
Anyway, upon receiving it from Amazon, I immediately installed the newest macOS **Ventura** 13.X from macOS **Monterey** 12.X.
Then I read up on the mac subreddit on how to optimally utilize my new 2022 M2 Macbook Air.
**The comments on reddit are mostly that Ventura is a shitshow.**
I wish that I'd known that before "upgrading" lol
Overall, I'm not futzing about it too much, and I'm extremely pleased with Apple on this. 
I've used Windows my whole life, and was just mind-blown by all the small conveniences that added up with the Mac.

In conclusion, an AI text scanner that could continuously scan the comments of reddit... and concisely report trend that may interest the used (AKA personalized) would be very convenient. Additionally, this concept could be expanded to not only search reddit, but also numerous other sources. e.g. Youtube, News, Entertainment, recent scholarly articles, etc. And not only to internalize the knowledge found, but provides spotaneous messages to its owner regarding recent trends that the owner may be interested in. e.g. I would like an AI helper buddy that could be like if Google could let me know if something new that interests me comes out like a new movie that my AI buddy knows I personally would enjoy. Or like if I just received a particularly important email (Not just marked "important" because that's often just an indicator of how important the sender thinks the message is. I want an AI that could let me know ACCURATELY how important the message would actually be to me. Privacy issues ofc, but these could potentially be circumvented. Anyway, enough with this tangent.) Of course youtube has a non-AI/ML un-personalized notification system set-up to let you know about youtube videos you might enjoy. And news headlines have their own notifications and attention-grabbing macheanisms. And videogame websites have their own notifications, and new scholarly articles get attention from blog posts, articles, word of mouth, forums, etc. 

But for a single AI to be the primary source of information for ALL of these things, collecting knowledge through expansive cloud infrastructure that consolidates all new information, and notifies you of the MOST important, relevant, and personalized updates. And more sources of information could be added over time.
